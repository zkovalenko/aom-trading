<h2>Core Market Forces</h2>
<p>
  Supply and Demand is one of the core strategies in professional trading.
  It is based on the ancient economic law that price in a free-flowing market is determined by
  the ongoing battle between buyers (demand) and sellers (supply).
</p>
<p>
  At its essence, price movement reflects imbalance — when one side temporarily overpowers the other.
  AOM Trading methodology harnesses this concept with high precision, identifying zones of institutional
  activity where these imbalances originate.
</p>

<h2>1. Market States: Balance vs. Imbalance</h2>
<p>Price action on any chart exists in two possible states:</p>

<h3>Imbalance</h3>
<p>
  A state where the market is out of equilibrium, meaning <strong>#Buyers ≠ #Sellers</strong>.
  When the market is imbalanced, price moves rapidly as one side dominates.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>If <strong>#Buyers &gt; #Sellers</strong>, price rises (bullish imbalance).</li>
  <li>If <strong>#Sellers &gt; #Buyers</strong>, price falls (bearish imbalance).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Balance</h3>
<p>
  A state of equilibrium, meaning <strong>#Buyers = #Sellers</strong>.
  In this phase, price consolidates or moves sideways, forming the base from which
  the next imbalance emerges.
</p>
<p>
  These transitions between balance and imbalance form the foundation of supply and demand analysis.
</p>

<h2>2. Supply Zones (Distribution Areas)</h2>
<p>
  A Supply Zone is a price region where selling pressure exceeds buying interest, often following
  a rally or extended downward move. It represents a distribution phase, where institutional traders
  unload positions, leading to a price decline.
</p>

<h3>Traits of Strong Supply Zones:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Formed at or near swing highs after an impulsive rally.</li>
  <li>Characterized by a sharp drop after a brief consolidation (Rally–Base–Drop pattern).</li>
  <li>Indicate unfilled sell orders that may trigger on retests.</li>
  <li>Often mark turning points in the market.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>AOM Application:</strong> When price revisits this zone, it's an opportunity to sell into strength,
  anticipating renewed institutional selling.
</p>

<h2>3. Demand Zones (Accumulation Areas)</h2>
<p>
  A Demand Zone is a region where buying pressure exceeds selling interest, typically following a sharp rally.
  It represents institutional accumulation, where large traders quietly build long positions before the next rally.
</p>

<h3>Traits of Strong Demand Zones:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Formed near swing lows after a rapid decline.</li>
  <li>Identified by a sharp rally after a narrow base (Drop–Base–Rally pattern).</li>
  <li>Reflects unfilled buy orders left behind by institutional buyers.</li>
  <li>Mark high-probability buying opportunities upon retest.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>AOM Application:</strong> When price revisits this zone, it's an opportunity to buy into weakness,
  aligning with institutional demand.
</p>

<h2>5. Strategic Summary</h2>
<p>
  Most supply and demand traders wait for price to enter these zones, where major buying or selling
  previously occurred, before entering a trade. By combining:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Imbalance recognition</li>
  <li>Wave context, and</li>
  <li>Institutional zone mapping,</li>
</ul>
<p>
  traders can identify high-probability entry points aligned with institutional activity.
