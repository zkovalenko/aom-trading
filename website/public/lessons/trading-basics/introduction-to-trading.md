<h2>How We Read the Market</h2>
<p>
  To consistently enter trades in high-probability zones, we use a <strong>multi-timeframe analysis process</strong>:
</p>

<h3>BTF – Boundary Time Frame</h3>
<p><em>(formerly called Large Time Frame)</em></p>
<p>Used to locate broader high-probability <strong>supply and demand zones</strong>.</p>

<h3>ATF – Analysis Time Frame</h3>
<p>
  The <strong>primary working timeframe</strong>. Here, we apply <strong>Wave Theory</strong>,
  <strong>Market Structure</strong>, and <strong>Supply/Demand analysis</strong> to identify
  the core trading zones.
</p>

<h3>ETF – Execution Time Frame</h3>
<p>
  The smallest timeframe, used for <strong>refining entries</strong> and
  <strong>optimizing risk-to-reward ratio</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Rule of Thumb</h3>
<p>
  Analysis always begins on the <strong>ATF</strong> to find a high probability area to enter trade.
  Most of the time, this is sufficient to identify the High Probability Zone.
