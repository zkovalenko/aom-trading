<h1>Trading Methodology</h1>
  <p>
    Our trading methodology is the result of years of market research, real-time analysis,
    and practical application across multiple asset classes. It has been tested in live
    market conditions and refined into a disciplined framework that gives traders structure
    and consistency.
  </p>

  <h2>Core Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Extensive Market Research</strong> across stocks, futures, and forex.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Analysis</strong> of price action and market structure.</li>
    <li><strong>Proven Strategies</strong> validated under live conditions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <p>Our methodology is designed to:</p>
  <ol style="margin: 0 2rem;">
    <li>Apply a <strong>top-down approach</strong> to market analysis.</li>
    <li>Equip traders with the skills to make <strong>informed, structured decisions</strong>.</li>
    <li>Build lasting competence in applying strategies consistently.</li>
    <li>Develop the <strong>confidence</strong> needed to navigate markets independently.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>How We Read the Market</h2>
  <p>To consistently enter trades in high-probability zones, we use a multi-timeframe analysis process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>BTF – Boundary Time Frame</strong> (formerly Large Time Frame): Used to locate broader high-probability supply and demand zones.</li>
    <li><strong>ATF – Analysis Time Frame:</strong> The primary working timeframe. Here, we apply Wave Theory, Market Structure, and Supply/Demand analysis to identify the core trading zones.</li>
    <li><strong>ETF – Execution Time Frame:</strong> The smallest timeframe, used for refining entries and optimizing risk-to-reward.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Rule of Thumb:</em> Analysis always begins on the <strong>ATF</strong> to establish context. Most of the time, this is sufficient to identify the High Probability Zone.</p>

    <p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Multi-timeframe trading process:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>Boundary Time Frame (BTF/LTF)</strong> sets the larger context.</li>
      <li>The <strong>Analysis Time Frame (ATF)</strong> identifies high-probability zones.</li>
      <li>The <strong>Execution Time Frame (ETF)</strong> provides refined entry signals inside those zones.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Special Cases</h2>

  <div class="case">
    <h3>Case 1: Trading Accounts Too Small for Full Zones</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Some traders cannot risk a position across the full ATF zone.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use the <strong>ETF</strong>. By aligning the high-probability ATF zone with a nested ETF zone, the effective zone size becomes smaller.</p>
    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Lower risk per trade and improved Reward-to-Risk ratio.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="case">
    <h3>Case 2: Missing Major Market Reversals</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> ATF analysis alone may overlook larger trend reversals.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use the <strong>BTF</strong> to identify high-probability zones opposite to the prevailing ATF wave sentiment.</p>
    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Early recognition of trend changes that cascade down to ATF and ETF, allowing traders to capture new directional moves.</p>
