  <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Multi-timeframe trading process. The Boundary Time Frame (BTF/LTF) sets the larger context, the Analysis Time Frame (ATF) identifies high-probability zones, and the Execution Time Frame (ETF) provides refined entry signals inside those zones.</p>
</div>

<h2>Special Cases</h2>
<p>There are scenarios where additional refinement is required:</p>

<h3>Case 1: Trading Accounts Too Small for Trading ATF Zones</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Some traders cannot afford to risk money based on ATF Zone size.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use the <strong>ETF</strong>. By aligning the high-probability ATF zone with a nested ETF zone, the effective zone size becomes smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Lower risk per trade and improved Reward-to-Risk ratio.</p>

<h3>Case 2: Missing Major Market Reversals</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> ATF analysis alone may overlook larger trend reversals.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use the <strong>BTF</strong> to identify high-probability zones opposite to the prevailing ATF wave sentiment.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Early recognition of trend changes that often cascade down to ATF and ETF, allowing traders to capture new directional moves.</p>
