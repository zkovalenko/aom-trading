<h1>Lesson 3: Real Time Examples</h1>

<p>
  This section applies the AOM methodology in real-world market scenarios, demonstrating how
  the Top-Down system isolates high-probability setups.
</p>

<h2>Core Scenarios:</h2>

<h3>1.1 New Zone Formation</h3>
<p>
  Identifying fresh institutional imbalances (new Supply or Demand Zone).
</p>
<p><em>Chart examples demonstrating New Zone Formation will be added here.</em></p>

<h3>1.2 New Wave Expansion</h3>
<p>
  Entering in the direction of the prevailing trend after confirmation.
</p>
<p><em>Chart examples demonstrating New Wave Expansion will be added here.</em></p>

<h3>1.3 New Wave Reversal</h3>
<p>
  Recognizing early signs of institutional flow reversal.
</p>
<p><em>Chart examples demonstrating New Wave Reversal will be added here.</em></p>

<h2>Each Example Walks Through:</h2>

<h3>2.1 Multi-timeframe Confirmation (ATF → BTF → ETF)</h3>
<p>
  How to validate setups across multiple timeframes to ensure alignment with institutional flow.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Tool Integration (MST, Wave Analyzer, OEP, ATM)</h3>
<p>
  Demonstrating how each tool in the AOM Tool Box contributes to the trade decision and execution process.
</p>

<h3>2.3 Trade Management Logic from Entry to Exit</h3>
<p>
  Complete workflow showing entry triggers, stop placement, target management, and exit strategies.
</p>

<p>
  Each case shows how ATF, BTF, and ETF charts interact with checklists to ensure structured decision-making.
</p>

<h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
<p>
  The Top-Down Trading Methodology unites structure, analysis, and automation into one coherent decision model.
  By following the AOM process, traders learn to:
</p>
<ul>
