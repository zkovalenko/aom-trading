<h1>Lesson 1: Introduction to AOM Trading Methodology</h1>

<p>
  This section introduces the core principles of the AOM Top-Down approach.
  It describes how institutional traders view the market as a hierarchy of structures — where
  higher timeframes define the context and lower timeframes define the timing.

<h2>Key Learning Points:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    The logic of starting from higher timeframes (ATF) to establish trend direction and
    locate major institutional zones.
  </li>
  <li>
    How to refine context in the Base Timeframe (BTF) for confirmation and confluence.
  </li>
  <li>
    How to pinpoint precise entries and stops in the Execution Timeframe (ETF).
  </li>
  <li>
    The principle of multi-timeframe alignment: trading in the direction of the
    dominant institutional flow.
  </li>
</ul>
